# rowporter :simple text report generator from tab-seperated tables
# (c) Tim Menzies, BSD license (2 paragraph version), 2016

# Requires: bash, awk, fmt, tr
# Tested on linux and mac. As to windows: let me know how that goes.
# Tested using Google sheets, has problems with Excel. Anyone?

# Usage:
#  [1] Write a spreadsheet where line1 are some headers
#  [2] Name it something; e.g. myreport1
#  [3] Do not use tabs in the spreadsheet.
#  [4] The right-hand side column header should be 'Notes'
#      (case does not matter). Repsheet ignores all columns
#      after this column.
#  [5] Write one report per row, under the headers. If a cell
#      needs a long comment, add it as e.g. [1] in the notes
#      column.
#  [6] Save the sheet, tab-seperated format. Excel will generate
#      XXX.txt and Google Sheets will generate 'XXX.tsv'. Remember
#      that magic extension. 
#  [7] Execute
#
#             bash rowporter 'XXX*YYY'
#
#      where XXX is the report name (e.g. myreport1) 
#      and YYY is the magic extension (e.g. tsv).
#  [8] Look for the file XXX*YYY.out. Paste text from there into
#      emails. Report done!
