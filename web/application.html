<h1>Thing About Grad Studies?</h1>

<p><em>
Please forgive this form letter as a reply but, as you might imagine, I get many such enquiries.</p>

<p>To start the application process, please go to <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/grad/programs/how-to-apply/index.php">this site</a>.</p>

<p>To help you out, I list below some answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<p>If the following does not answers your questions then please feel free to email me and I will do my best to reply to your queries.</p>

<p>Best wishes, <br/>
Tim Menzies</em></p>

<h2>About Applying</h2>

<p>American universities accept new graduate students for start-of-study in mid-August and mid-January.</p>

<p>The application process for those dates starts months in advance. You should be planning your application at least one year before your desired start date.
I have no authority to accept students but, once they are accepted, I can supervise graduate students. So please review our admissions procedures at our departmental Web site.</p>

<p>That said, during the admissions review process, all faculty are sent a sheet listing the candidate students and I am allowed to "nudge" a handful of names. So if you elect to enroll here then please ping me so I can watch for your application in the system.</p>

<h2>Tips for writing to Professors</h2>

<p>When writing to a CS prof in the USA, here is some advice on how to attract their attention.</p>

<p>Do not send a form letter-- we get enough of those.</p>

<p>To prove that you are not sending a form letter, best to make some reference to their current research, perhaps even to one of their recent papers (and how your prior work or interests match up).</p>

<p>Demonstrate that you have done a little homework before sending and email about the department. E.g.</p>

<ul>
    <li>read over the department's recruitment policies and say things like "I am targeting an application for your next round of applications for (say) January 2016 which I will submit to <insert correct email name or web page reference here>".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working with me</h2>

<p>As to me supervising you, I do not take on students until they have completed one of my grad subjects. This lets us check each other out before we commit too much to each other.</p>

<p>As to funding, I do not guarantee that my supervised students get funding from me. Funding comes and goes depending on the whims of the funding agencies and my policy is to fund my long-term Ph.D. students before anyone else.</p>

<ul>
    <li>That said, for your information, over the last decade, 75% of my students were fully funded.</li>
</ul>
