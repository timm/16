# Conventions

## Settings

Magic parameters are stored in functions that start with an UPPER CASE name 
and are decorated by `@setting`. e,g

```
@setting
def CUT(): return o( 
  crowded=4, 
  cohen=0.1,
  fayyad=False
)
```

Once written that way, we say that the above numbers are the _defaults_
for the global dictionary `the.CUT`.

These parameters can be accessed in the natural way:

    the.CUT.cohen    # returns 0.1

The defaults can   be altered as follows:

    CUT(cohen=0.2)
    
These values can be reset to their initial _defaults_ using:

     reset(seed=1)

This call finds **all** sets and sets them back to their _defaults_
(as well as resetting the random number seed to _"1"_). 
    
## Tests

Every file tests itself; e.g. 

    python boot.py

Runs test scripts in boot.py.

-  [ ] boot.py  
-  [ ] lib.py  
-  [ ] counts.py  
-  [ ] space.py
-  
control.py  
log.py  
model.py 
models.py  
mutate.py  
old/    
sway.txt
